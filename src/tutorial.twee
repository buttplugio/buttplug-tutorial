:: Platform Selection [disconnect]

First off, we're going to need to know which operating system you're running.
<!--
TODO: Fill this in once we have platform detection code running.

It looks like you're running (Insert Operation System Detection Here).

If the above is incorrect, or if you're interested in checking out a
tutorial about another operating system, use one of the links below to
choose the operating system you're using.
-->
<<nobr>>
<ul>
<<for _os range [$win7, $win10, $macos, $ios, $linux, $android, $chromeos]>>
<li><<ossuplink _os>></li>
<</for>>
</ul>
<</nobr>>
:: Toy Compatibility [disconnect]

We support the following hardware on ''$opsys'':
<<nobr>>
<ul>
<<toycompat "XBox 360/XBox One Compatible Gamepads" `[$win7, $win10]`>>
<<toycompat "Erostek ET312B" `[$win7, $win10]`>>
<<bluetooth "Fleshlight Launch">>
<<bluetooth "Vorze A10 Cyclone">>
<<bluetooth "Lovense Toys (Max/Nora/Hush/Lush/Ambi/Edge/Osci/Domi)">>
<<bluetooth "WeVibe Toys (4/4 Plus/Ditto/Nova/Pivot/Wish/Verge/Cougar)">>
<<bluetooth "Magic Motion Toys">>
<<bluetooth "Vibratissimo Toys">>
<<bluetooth "Youcups Warrior II">>
</ul>
<</nobr>>

If you don't see the hardware you have here or if the list is empty, don't worry! You can still check out the rest of this tutorial, we have a simulator that will let you see what a toy would do even if you don't have one available.

If you have hardware we don't currently support, [[let us know on our message board so we can get that fixed |https://metafetish.club/t/survey-which-devices-and-operating-systems-would-you-like-to-see-supported/66]]!

[[Let's talk about connecting to a server|Connecting to Buttplug]]!

:: Connecting to Buttplug [disconnect connectpassage]

Here's a list of ways you can use Buttplug on ''$opsys''.

<div id="websocketapp" class="hide">
!! Websocket Server

The websocket server application runs on your computer, and allows other applications and webpages to use Buttplug to control toys.

[[Let's get the application installed!|Windows Websocket Server Installation]]
</div>
<div id="inbrowser" class="hide">
!! In Your Browser
If you're using a browser that has WebBluetooth available, you don't need an outside application to use Buttplug. Everything you need is built into your browser.
<<if navigator.bluetooth>>
Your browser has bluetooth capabilities.
<<link "Let's get connected!">>
<!-- At this point, we can go ahead and connect locally, since that will never fail -->
<<buttplugconnectlocal>>
<<connecting>>
<<success>>
<<goto "Scan For Devices">>
<<failure>>
<</buttplugconnectlocal>>
<</link>>
<<else>>
It looks like you're running a browser that doesn't have WebBluetooth capabilities, which means we can't use it control hardware.
The only browser that currently supports WebBluetooth is [[Google Chrome|https://google.com/chrome]] Version 56 or higher on macOS, Linux, Android, or iOS. We hope this capability will be coming to Firefox in the nearish future.

If you'd like to continue the tutorial, check out the "Simulator" section below.
Otherwise, you can [[go back to the platform selection screen|Platform Selection]], or <<link "Restart the tutorial">><<reset>><</link>>.
<</if>>
</div>
<div id="mobile" class="hide">
!! Mobile App
If you're on iOS or Android, we have a mobile app available! Or at least, we will. Someday. This space will have more information about that once it's actually a thing.
</div>\
<div>
!! Simulator
Don't have a device handy, or on a platform we don't have hardware access on yet, but just want to see how things work?
You can use our simulator to visualize how toys will move, without having to worry about hooking things up!
[[Let's check out the Simulator!|Simulator]]
</div>
<div>
!! Go Back to Platform Selection
If you selected the wrong platform, [[you can return to platform selection.|Platform Selection]]
</div>

:: Windows Websocket Server Installation [disconnect]

To install the Websocket Server, you'll need to get the installer.

[[The installer is available on github.|https://github.com/metafetish/buttplug-csharp/releases]]

Once you've got that downloaded and installed, [[we can move on to trying to connect.|Websocket Browser Connection]]

:: Websocket Browser Connection [disconnect]

Now then, go to the start menu, and start the Websocket Server.

Make sure that the "SSL/TLS" box is checked.

Assuming you're running your web browser on the same machine as the Buttplug Server, you shouldn't need to change the host address. However, if you're running your browser on one machine and the server on another, change the value below to use the address of the server.

Host Address: <<set _hostaddrlink to '"""' + $hostaddr + '"""'>><<linkreplace "_hostaddrlink (Click to Change)">><<textbox "$hostaddr" $hostaddr autofocus>><</linkreplace>>

<div id="initialconnect">
<<link "Click here to try to connect">><<wsconnect>><<addclass "#initialconnect" "hide">><</link>>
</div>

<div id="connector" class="hide">
Trying to connect, just a second...
</div>

<div id="success" class="hide">
Great, you've connected! You should now see something like this status on the websocket server dialog:
[[Now we can scan for devices.|Scan For Devices]]
</div>

<div id="failure" class="hide">
The connection failed. If you look at the server dialog, you may see something like this:
This means we need to set up the self-signed security certificate in your browser.
To do this, we'll need to visit the websocket server, then accept the certificate.

<<nobr>>
<<link "Click here to open a new tab and accept the certificate.">>
<<script>>
window.open(State.variables.hostaddr.replace("wss://", "https://"), '_blank').focus();
<</script>>
<</link>>
<</nobr>>

Once that's done, <<link "Click here to try to connecting again.">><<wsconnect>><</link>>
</div>

:: Simulator [disconnect]

The Buttplug Device Simulator allows you to use simulated devices instead of real ones, so you can at least see what Buttplug would do if actual hardware were available.

On the side menu of this tutorial, select the "Show Device Panel" option, or else <<link "just click here">><<buttplugdevtoolsshowdevices>><</link>>. This will bring up a floating panel that shows test devices. These devices can be connected to and will send/receive commands like an actual hardware device. They will also animate based on the commands sent to them.

The panel can be moved around like a desktop window, so you can move it out of the way of the text it's probably over right now by dragging the "Test Device Manager" title bar around.

You'll want to leave the device panel in view for the rest of the tutorial. If you close it, you can just reopen it using the side menu.

<<link "Now, let's scan for devices.">>
<<buttplugconnectdevtools>>
<<connecting>>
<<success>>
<<goto "Scan For Devices">>
<<failure>>
<</buttplugconnectdevtools>>
<</link>>

:: Scan For Devices [devicescanpassage]
Let's see what devices we can discover.

If you're going to try this with a bluetooth device, turn it on now and put it close by.

<div id="startscanning">
<<link "Click here to start scanning">>

<</buttplugscanningfinishedhandler>>
<</if>>

<div id="devicefound" class="hide">
Now that we've found some devices, [[let's send them some commands|Test Devices]].
</div>

:: Test Devices

Below is a list of your currently connected devices, along with various actions they can run. If you click the link, the device will perform the specified action. Give it a shot!

<<nobr>>
<ul>
<<for _device range setup.bpClient.Devices>>
<<capture _device>>
<li>_device.name</li>
<ul>
<<for _msg range _device.AllowedMessages>>
<<if _msg eq "SingleMotorVibrateCmd">>
  <li>
  <<link "Click here to Vibrate for 1 second">>
