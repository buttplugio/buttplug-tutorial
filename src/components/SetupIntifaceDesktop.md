Now we need to get Intiface Desktop ready to connect.

This tutorial assumes you are running Intiface Desktop on the same
computer as this web browser. If you are trying to connect to Intiface
Desktop remotely, please see this support article.

* Go to the Server Status Panel
* Make sure "Regular Websockets" is checked.
* Hit "Start Server"

When that's done, <router-link to="create-intiface-connection" class="router-link">click here to try connecting</router-link>
