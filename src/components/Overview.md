Here's a quick overview of how this tutorial, and how Intiface itself, works:

- First, we'll get you set up with Intiface, either Intiface Desktop
  or with Intiface Web inside your browser.
- Then you'll connect the tutorial to whichever version of Intiface we
  set up.
- Now we'll get to the hardware part. Next, you'll scan for devices.
  This is usually done in Intiface/Buttplug applications, so that you
  don't need to leave the UI in order to find new devices.
- Finally, once you've found some devices, we'll run some quick
  movement tests on them to make sure everything works!
