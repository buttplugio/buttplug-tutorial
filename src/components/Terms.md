One of the most frequent questions we get is about the difference in
_Intiface_ and _Buttplug_, so to clear that up before we start:

**Buttplug** is the name of a library that developers use to write
programs that can control sex toys. If you want to write code for sex
toys, you'll use Buttplug. If you just want to use your sex toys with
applications, you will want to look for applications that may list
themselves as using _Buttplug_.

**Intiface** is the name of a set of applications built on top of
_Buttplug_ by the Buttplug Development Team. These applications can be
used to easily connect to different Buttplug Applications. This
tutorial will teach you how to use the following applications:

* Intiface Desktop, an application for Windows, Mac and Linux
* Intiface Web, which allows some web browsers to control sex toys and other hardware.
