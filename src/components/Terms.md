One of the most frequent questions we get is about the difference in
_Intiface_ and _Buttplug_, so to clear that up before we start:

**Device** is the catch-all term we use to refer to any type of
hardware that we can communicate with using Intiface. This could be a
sex toy (vibrator, buttplug, etc), e-stim equipment, fucking machines,
electric toothbrushes, or whatever else we've decided to add support
for.

**Buttplug** is the name of the library that developers use to write
programs that can control certain devices. If you want to write code
for supported devices, you'll use Buttplug. If you just want to use
your sex toys with applications, you will want to look for
applications that may list themselves as using _Buttplug_.

**Intiface** is a set of applications built on top of _Buttplug_, by
the Buttplug Development Team. These applications can be used to
easily connect to different Buttplug Applications. This tutorial will
teach you how to use the following applications:

* Intiface Desktop, an application for Windows, Mac and Linux
* Intiface Web, which allows some web browsers to control supported
  devices.

**Nonpolynomial** is the company that puts out both Intiface and
Buttplug.
