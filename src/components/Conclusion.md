That's it! You've now run through a complete Intiface session.

Usually, Intiface sessions will end in something slightly more
interesting than "make devices run for a second", but the goal of this
tutorial is to get you up and on your way as fast as possible, so
we're keeping it simple.

Things to try next:

- Talk to other Intiface users and Buttplug developers on the
  [Buttplug
  Discord](https://discord.buttplug.io)
- Learn more about the system by reading our [Knowledge Base](https://nonpolynomial.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)
- Hijacking video game rumble for sex toys with the [Intiface Game
  Haptics Router](https://intiface.com/ghr).
- Find out more about [how movie sync
  works](https://youtu.be/qgdk77C5SFc) (check out other videos on [the
  Buttpluggin' with qDot Channel](https://youtube.buttplug.io) for
  more ideas!).
- Learn to make applications using Buttplug with the [Buttplug
  Developer Guide](https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io)
