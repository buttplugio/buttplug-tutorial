**Welcome to the Intiface Tutorial!**

We'll be teaching you how to connect your devices to applications
using Intiface, either as a desktop application or in a browser.

A quick guide to our icons:

<i class="router-link"></i> denotes a link that will take you to the
next tutorial step.

<a></a> denotes an external link that will open in a new tab.

<router-link to="/terms" class="router-link">On to terminology...</router-link>
