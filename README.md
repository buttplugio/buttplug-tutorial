## Buttplug

For more information on the Buttplug Sex Toy Control Protocol, visit
the main repo at

[https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug)

There, you can find more information on the protocol, as well as
library implementations and other applications using the protocol.

## Building

Building the tutorial requires
[tweego](https://bitbucket.org/tmedwards/tweego), which in turn will
require the go language environment installed on your machine.

To install tweego using our Makefile, you can run

```
make install
```

This will install the tweego package for you, or upgrade it if it's
already installed.

Once you have tweego installed, you can just run "make" and it will
build the tutorial into the "build" directory.

## Support The Project
